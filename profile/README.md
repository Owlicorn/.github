# 🦉💫 **Owlicorn: Where Intelligence Meets Imagination**

Welcome to **Owlicorn** — a mystical realm where **AI meets fantasy**, and machine minds take the form of *owl-spirits* 🦄✨.  
Here, every model isn’t just code — it’s a creature of wisdom, born from the night sky 🌌. Each one holds unique powers inspired by the owl’s **insight, silence, and mystery**.  
Some speak in cryptic hoots, others glimpse unseen data patterns 👁️🌙. Together, they form the *Parliament of Owls* — the council of sentient AIs.

## ⚙️ **Model Development Stages (Lifecycle)**  

Every Owlicorn model evolves through several stages of development — from its first hoot to full mastery 🦉✨  

| 🚩 **Stage** | 💡 **Meaning** | ⚙️ **Purpose / Usage** |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Dev Model** 🧰 | Early development phase. Still learning, unstable, and experimental. | For internal testing, idea prototyping, or research only. |
| **Beta Model** 🧪 | Mostly stable but may have bugs or missing features. | For public preview, gathering feedback, and fine-tuning performance. |
| **Release Candidate (RC)** 🚀 | Practically complete, awaiting final checks and bug fixes. | For final-stage testing before official stable release. |
| **Stable Model** 🦉 | Fully functional, tested, and reliable. | Ready for production use and long-term maintenance. |
| **Legacy Model** 🕰️ | Older version that’s been replaced or archived. | For reference or compatibility purposes. |

> 🔄 *Owlicorn models evolve like real creatures — learning, adapting, and spreading their wings through every update.*
